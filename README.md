#Geovation - My Home Energy Planner

##Summary:
A way for householders to very quickly obtain accurate, comprehensive and usable information on the energy performance of their homes.

##Problems:
Common problems around accurate home energy modelling and retrofit solutions.
Housing stock one of least efficient in Europe; 2m homes in fuel poverty with knock on implications for health impacts
Though homes are biggest purchase people make they know little about how they work and how they could be improved
Trusted competent advice is hard to come by

##Solution:
Opening up a complex tool to the wider public
Enabling people to self assess, a free, user-friendly entry point into the pro service
Looking for compromise between ease of use and accuracy: something OS and Land Registry data allows us to do

Enter your address and the tool populates floor areas, external wall information + a few simple questions means we can deliver a report with 80% of the accuracy of our paid-for pro version
Provides a context for comparison with other local or similar householders, see case studies, links to Community Energy organisations and funding opportunities
Relies on ability to access OS data through partnering with a local authority
Enables users to profile existing energy usage and gain an idea of what retrofit improvements might be possible, provides a pathway for future investment and, where applicable, grant assistance

##Dissemination:
