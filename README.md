# Geovation - My Home Energy Planner 
A project developed by [Carbon Co-op](http://carbon.coop) and [Urbed](http://urbed.coop). Give it a go at  [myhomeenergysalford.carbon.coop/](http://myhomeenergysalford.carbon.coop/).

## Summary: 
A way for individuals and organisations to quickly obtain accurate, comprehensive, and usable information on the energy performance of UK homes.

## Problems: 
* Lack of accuracy in home energy modelling and retrofit solutions. 
* UK housing stock is some of the least efficient in Europe.
* 2m UK homes are in fuel poverty with additional implications for health and wellbeing. 
* Homes are the biggest purchase people make and they know little about how they work and how they could be improved. 
* Trusted competent advice is hard to come by.

## Solution 
* Making a building energy model accessible to the wider public with an acceptable compromise between accuracy and ease of use. 
* Enabling people to self assess using a free and user-friendly entry point with the options to upgrade to a professional service as needed.

Enter your address and the tool populates floor areas and external wall information. Combined with a few simple questions this can deliver a report with 80% of the accuracy of the professional service. Also provides a context for comparison with other local houses, see case studies, links to Community Energy organisations and funding opportunities Relies on ability to access OS data through partnering with a local authority Enables users to profile existing energy usage and gain an idea of what retrofit improvements might be possible, provides a pathway for future investment and, where applicable, grant assistance

## Dissemination: 
Via Community Energy organisations through networks and professional support organisations such as NEF (National Energy Foundation), Community Energy England

Sustainability Subsidy from the pro version Finders fees Through partnering with CCGs and Local Authority to provide assistance on Fuel Poverty

## Development project 
Pilot project in Greater Manchester utilising existing relationships with the 10 local authorities and the city region’s combined authority Assist with addressing fuel poverty targets

## Ordnance Survey data 
The tool uses a dataset of Salford City Council. CarbonCoop has signed a License to use it for the pourpose of the tool but cannot disclosure the contents of the dataset. Therefore anybody who want to use the tool with full functionality will require get a similar License.

## Who are the users? 
Existing members People motivated to take action but who don’t know what to do Not mass market > identify segments Provides and entry level Funding model: professional tool, paid-for service, resources back end core tool Paid for = people who want to progress work Using the tenure and property type data (a semi in a specific area), freehold/leasehold (enables you to identify barriers at early stage)
