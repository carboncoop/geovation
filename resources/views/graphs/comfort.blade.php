		<p class='graph-info js-graph-info'>This graph shows how much energy your home needs to keep warm. The lower the number, the less energy you need to be comfortable and the most likely you will keep the heating on until you reach the right temperature. On the other hand, if this number is very high, your house losses a lot of heat and you will need to keep the heating on for longer making it more unlikely for you to reach a comfortable temperature.</p>
